      <p>I am a recent undergraduate with a degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Economics from McGill University. Over the years, programming and creating new things has become a passion of mine. I have developed a newly found interest in areas of studies such as Natural Language Processing and Social Media Computational Analysis.</p>
      <p>As a friendly-neighborhood brown guy who spent his entire schooling years in Japan, I can speak Hindi, English and Japanese. I am also interested in playing guitar, board-games and cards. If you're looking towards working with someone with an interdisciplinary background and an interest in Computer Science, feel free to shoot me a message! I would love to be part of new exciting ventures.</p>
